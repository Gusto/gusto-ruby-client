# PayrollBatchResultsStatus

The lifecycle status of the batch request itself. Terminal values are `completed` (processing finished — inspect `results` and `exclusions` for per-payroll outcomes) and `failed` (the batch crashed at the system level; can be retried). This is distinct from the per-payroll `status` returned inside `results[]`. A `completed` batch does not imply every payroll was cancelled.

## Example Usage

```ruby
require "gusto_embedded_client_v_2026_06_15"

value = PayrollBatchResultsStatus::PENDING
```


## Values

| Name         | Value        |

| `COMPLETED`  | completed    |
| `FAILED`     | failed       |
