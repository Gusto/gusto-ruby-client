    # FederalTaxDetailsStatus - The status of EIN verification:
    # - `pending`: The EIN verification process has not completed (or the company does not yet have an EIN).
    # - `verified`: The EIN has been successfully verified as a valid EIN with the IRS.
    # - `failed`: The company's EIN did not pass verification. Common issues are being entered incorrectly or not matching the company's legal name.
