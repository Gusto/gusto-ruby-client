    # CurrentEmploymentStatus - The current employment status of the employee. Full-time employees work 30+ hours per week. Part-time employees are split into two groups: those that work 20-29 hours a week, and those that work under 20 hours a week. Variable employees have hours that vary each week. Seasonal employees are hired for 6 months of the year or less.
